# MakeMeABlender
MakeMeABlender is a Windows app that lets you make custom Blender installations that pull the latest commits and changes along with pull requests that you hand pick. This lets you gain access to new Blender features ahead-of-time, easily.

Features:
 - Make blender installations, with any branch or combination of pull requests
 - Stay up-to-date with the latest developments and changes, with a news feed that supports notifications.
 - All setup is reduced to three simple buttons: Pull, Build and Run. No running commands in console.
 - Missing library detection: MakeMeABlender automatically detects when you are missing libraries or software, and gives you an overview of what you need to download and where to get it.
